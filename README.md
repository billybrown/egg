# egg
A starting point for my web projects.

Uses assemble for templating, libsass for css, and assumes deployment to github pages.

## to do

- integrate grunt favicon generator
- Create and integrate a coding styleguide and css architecture readme

## on hold

- Sass source maps. There is a bug currently in libsass - waiting for final release of libsass 2.0.
- Scss linting. The only grunt plugin for scss-lint requires a ruby dependency - which we don't want.
